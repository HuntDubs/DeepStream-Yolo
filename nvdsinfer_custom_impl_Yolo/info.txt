Plan for this week:
    -Finish comments on each of the layers that were used in yolov5
    -Write the google docs documentation on how the config and weight files are processed
    -"How does the parser take the final layer output of the model and create a bounding box, the confidence and the class ID"










Names of headers from weights file:
